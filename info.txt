Purpose of this project is to practice if statements and loops in assembly and in c

I want to get input from the user using the c program and testing the input in there with if statements 

THen I want to actually calculate the loop they want with my assembly program to optimize its performence 


A Even more optimal way would be if I Remove the conditional branching And not use if statements in my C program 
But instead use the set flags to determine if they entered valid data
